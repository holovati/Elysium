This is just a backup Repository.
As far as I know there is no database dump in there (no world db) - also the repo consists of zip files. Maybe I'll at least make a proper repo instead of the zipfile shenanigans.

# Nostalrius & Elysium Core files

The files available for download belong to the original Nostalrius team, included also are the core files for the Elysium project Anathema.

Anathema: Old core before Nostalrius
